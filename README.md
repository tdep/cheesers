### A Python based, simplified chess game for two loacal players

This is a simple version of chess, which I will explain in a minute, that I created as an exercise to practice Python.
It originally was meant to be an exericise from the book <em>Automate the Boring Stuff</em> chapter 5, but I got carried
away.

The reason this is <em>simplified</em> is because of how the mechanics work. In this version, checkmate is determined by
one of three conditions:
    - One of the players has only the King remaining.
    - The King of one of the players is captured.
    - One of the players forfeits.

Since I wasn't looking to get deep into checking for available moves, I decided this might be an easy way to still have
a game that felt a little like chess and still be kind of fun. Maybe this will change, but probably not.

As this is a text based version, it must be run in an interactive Python shell. 
To do this, run the following in the root directory after forking and cloning the repo:

`python -i main.py`

That's it! Oh, and make sure you have Python installed of course. 

More updates to come!
